# VU-Node-Scripts
A few scripts to reinforce Bitcoin blockchain understanding ran on VU Node

## *calculateFee.py*
A beautiful script, that calculates the given transaction fee!

It's done by simply manipulating the Python Bitcoin API to work with the connected Node

## *hashValidate.py*
An even more beautiful script, that checks the validity of a given block

It basically takes the header information, parses it, and calculates the hash accordingly.

Then it compares the two hashes, and tadaa! You validated it, my friend :fire:

## How to run the script
**You must have *python-bitcoinlib* installed**
<br>**Connection to the bitcoin node is also needed**
<br> Run the following script:
<br>```python caclulateFee.py```
<br> or
<br> ```python hashValidate.py```
